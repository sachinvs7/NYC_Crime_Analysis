# NYC_Crime_Analysis

### I have penned a complete breakdown for this project at my [website](https://www.sachinvs.ml/proj_nypd_analysis). All data sources are from the New York Police Department; available at https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/crime-statistics/citywide-crime-stats.page (way too large to upload here). I would like to emphasize that my modeling intuitions, observations and results are by no means de-facto findings. This was developed as part of a personal learning curve for a university course. Zipped files contain screenshots and notebooks.
